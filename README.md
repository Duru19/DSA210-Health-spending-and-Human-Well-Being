# DSA210-Health-spending-and-Human-Well-Being
Analysis of the relationship between healthcare spending and human well-being using real-world data from international sources.

# Motivation

I found this topic interesting and wanted to work on it because I see that the healthcare sector is becoming more expensive every year.
In my own environment, I notice that some people even delay their medical check-ups because of the rising costs. That’s why I wanted to focus on this issue and explore how it can be related to mental health, life expectancy, and many other factors. It’s both a cultural and analytical topic that affects our daily lives, and I believe studying something that directly concerns our most valuable asset ,our health ,is very meaningful.

# Data Sources

Life expectancy data, mental health, health insurance,health spending: This project uses country-level data from Our World in Data to explore how healthcare spending and insurance coverage relate to life expectancy, mental health, and overall well-being.

# Method

I used secondary, country-level data from Our World in Data to explore the relationship between healthcare spending and human well-being. The datasets includes variables such as health expenditure per capita, life expectancy, mental health prevelence, government healthspending, insurance coverage. 
The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, correlation, and simple regression to examine how healthcare costs and insurance coverage are related to life expectancy and mental health across countries.

# My hypothesis

My expectation is that in countries where the healthcare sector is becoming more expensive, people’s access to medical services decreases, which in turn negatively affects their personal health and overall life quality.
